# Let's get technical

Hey 🌦️

Here's the exercises you gave me.
I wanted to do more on the weather app, but I didn't have enough time to complete everything. Nevertheless, I finished the required part and added some extra features. You can take a look at the final design plan on Figma here: https://www.figma.com/file/QvHFPcgBxUfUzIeVBmwMwa/Weather-app?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=9wS6QMmdnYdtmjWc-1

Thanks again for the opportunity ☀️
