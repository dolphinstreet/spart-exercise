# Fizz Buzz

1. Write a function that:
   - takes a `number` as argument and logs all the integers from `0` up to and including said number.
   - when the number is divisible by `3` logs `Fizz`.
   - when the number is divisible by `5` logs `Buzz`.
   - when the number is divisible by both `3` and `5` logs `FizzBuzz`.
   - otherwise logs the `number` itself.
   - It should handle invalid input.
2. Update the function to keep the previous behaviour and add `7` as `Bazz`:
   - log `Bazz` when the number is divisible by `7`.
   - log `FizzBazz` when the number is divisible by `7` and `3`.
   - log `BuzzBazz` when the number is divisible by `7` and `5`.
   - log `FizzBuzzBazz` when the number is divisible by `7` and `3` and `5`.
